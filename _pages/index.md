# Welcome!

My name is ~~Shashank~~ however I'm known as **_Shank_**. Currently a student who loves Cyber Security. I still unable to make up my mind whether I would love working in `Red Team` or `Blue Team`. 

I have poked in many areas such as `Incident Handling`, `Network Security`, `Pentesting AD & Systems`, `Exploit Development`, `Application security`, `Malware Development`, `Digital Forensics`, `Cloud Security`, `IDS Systems`, `OS Security`, `Reverse Engineering` and much more!!

I do enjoy learning and working on those areas, thus I'm uncertain on the path I should focus on. However during my free time, I do use platforms like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) & [Pwnable](https://pwnable.xyz/) to advance my learning. And yeah, I love participating in CTF competitions. I always learn lots of goodies from there :)

Do check out my writeups on CTFs and Platform Solutions. ~~Still Working On It~~
